Also, this code is broken.. I've been looking at my client.js for too long and it just isn't working the way I want it to. It probably has to do with specificity of paths however when I try to change the paths of each variable and whatnot, it doesn't really change anything. I want to submit this on time, however over time I would like to continue adding to it until I can fully fix and understand it. I'm ok with getting less marks, but I would love feedback and I would like to send it to you again later (without any marks is ok) to see if you could proofread it for me when I do fix it.
